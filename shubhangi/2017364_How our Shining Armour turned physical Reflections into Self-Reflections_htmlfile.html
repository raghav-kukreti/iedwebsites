<h1>How our Shining Armour turned physical Reflections into Self-Reflections</h1>
<br>
</br>
<p1>While it felt exciting to be building something tangible and working, from scratch, for the first time, there were also realisations amidst the learning. Apart from the technical learning that we, of course, were unfamiliar with, including working with sensors and their codes, wires, machines, and materials that give the product a physical structure, there were also kinds of learning such as about how to go about working on and with such projects. Most important of all was how by the end of our project, we realised that the outer as well as the internal structure may seem to, but can’t be worked out in absolute exclusion of each other, as eventually they end up being a part of each other which needs to be fitting perfectly. Despite it being worked out fairly well, looking at the minor details of our work, which could be fixed only later in the process, this learning somehow became the most essential for us, for the future.</p1>
